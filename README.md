# fesc-redesign
This is a redesign project of the [FESC website](http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu/).
## Chart Selection
The charts added in Research page are implemented using the [Google Line Chart Library](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart). Line chart was chosen for the energy production and electricity consumption graphs because it shows the small changes in the data set over a period of time. Compared to scatter chart, line chart also reflects the trend of the data over time. In this case, it shows both of the renewable energy production and electricity consumption increase over time.
